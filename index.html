				<h1>[2025] Cloudy, with a chance of errors</h1>
			</header>
			<p>This was my first web project, which I made as coursework. The purpose of this site is to show the difference between weather forecasters, comparing them for accuracy. This exposed me to all elements of full-stack development, and I picked up basics from all of it!</p>

				<h1>[2026] PennySaver</h1>
			</header>
			<p>This was my second web project, and I'm so proud of the progress I've made since Cloudy. I have a much deeper understanding of how to code frontends effectively, and I have a far cleaner database structure behind the scenes. This project was also for coursework, and it was extremely ambitious. From this project, I've learned to deal with real-world issues. I've dealt with unclean, irregular and incredibly varied data. When I'm finished with my course, I'll come back to this, as there's still so many more ideas.</p>

				<h1>🎶 YTMusic Fixer</h1>
			</header>
			<p>This has been a major hobby project of mine. I started this before making CLoudy, and am still working on it now. I'll always defend Youtube Music over Spotify, as it's far more cost effective. However, I think the YTMusic site has lots to improve on. That's why I made this web extension. I used this project to gather a deep understanding of frontend development techniques, as I spent lots of time reading the YTM source code. This isn't for public use yet, but one day it might be! (At this point, I've spent so long on this, I could've built the entire service from scratch!)</p>

				<h1>💡 SmartHome+</h1>
			</header>
			<p>In the summer of 2025, I collected a few smart bulbs and wanted to code with them. My plan was to synchronise them with music. I researched before I bought, and discovered a category called 'zigbee', which is very common. I now have a zigbee USB dongle, HomeAssistant software installed on my Raspberry Pi, and my own Python API for controling the lights.</p>

				<h1>🎇 RGB Strip Lights</h1>
			</header>
			<p>Last christmas, I bought a strip of RGB addressable leds. I had always had my Raspberry Pi 4, but I learned how to use a microcontroller specifically (Pi Pico 2W). I connected this to the light strip and created a Python interface to control the lights through a socket. I built preset designs, and hooked it up to MIDI piano, which caused lights as you played keys!</p>

				<h1>🎅 Santa's Workshop</h1>
			</header>
			<p>A few years ago, I made a Roblox game for Christmas. It was a fun little game to work for Santa to prepare presents and deliver them! This was my first EVER project that I successfully completed.</p>

			<p>Around the same time as Santa's Workshop, I made a really simple halloween trick-or-treat game!</p>
